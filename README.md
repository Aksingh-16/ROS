# ROS
This repository demonstrates a ROS-based implementation to control Turtlesim's turtle to move in a rectangular path. It showcases key ROS concepts like nodes, publishers, and topics. The code is available in Python and C++, with customizable rectangle dimensions and speeds, making it ideal for learning ROS basics.


# Inside the scripts folder, create a new Python file (e.g., move_turtle_rectangle.py):

cd ros_session/scripts
touch move_turtle_rectangle.py
chmod +x move_turtle_rectangle.py
